# Colorblindness
An App designed to help people stricken with a common eye disorder: color-blindness. We were inspired by Miguel Neiva’s work, a Portuguese designer who created a visual code for colors in 2010.  How it works  Like a color picker, point the camera on the object or color area you want to know more about for an instant analysis of its color and shade. You can also click on the target to lock the selection on the screen and its color analysis. If you want to know more about how Neiva’s color code works, just swipe left and have fun trying out our color puzzle. To discover the world around you as would a 100% colour-blind person do, swipe right and switch from colourful vision to colorless mode.
